# Blockchain Visual Conventions

## Block Chain Arrows

When showing blocks linked in a chain (e.g. in consensus slot animations):

- **Arrow direction**: The arrow always points from the **new block** to the **older block**
- This represents the "prev" or "parent" link: each new block references the previous one
- Example: `[block 1] ← [block 2] ← [block 3]` (block 2 links to block 1, block 3 links to block 2)
